# acme_group_bstack_app_automate

End to end CI triggered automation run for mobile application testing

This pipeline runs tests on BrowserStackâ€™s App Automate and App Percy platform along with reports on the Test Observability dashboard. Pretty awesome. :heart_eyes:

# How to run
To run this test suite, simply clone the repository and fire up the `add a command here`
from the top directory as shown below
```
add the same command here

```

It runs the sample test cases on the chosen **real** devices in
parallel on Browserstack App Automate

Which devices are being used?
It can be seen in the `Add path to the file` file
You can choose to change the choice of devices by specifying different capabilities.

For ease of use: use [Browserstack's capability generator](https://www.browserstack.com/app-automate/capabilities)

It can also be triggered from the github actions.
Simply go to the "Actions" tab on this repo and trigger a workflow.


**HAPPY TESTING**
