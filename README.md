# acme_group_bstack_app_automate

End to end CI triggered automation run for mobile application testing

This pipeline runs tests on BrowserStackâ€™s App Automate and App Percy platform along with reports on the Test Observability dashboard. Pretty awesome. :heart_eyes:

# How to run
To run this test suite:
* simply clone the repository
* install the percy client
* set your environment variables and
* fire up the `npx percy app:exec -- mvn clean test -P bstack-parallel-devices` from the top directory as shown below
```
npm install @percy/cli
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<username>
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESSKEY=<accesskey>
export PERCY_TOKEN=<percy_token>
npx percy app:exec -- mvn clean test -P bstack-parallel-devices

```

It runs the sample test cases on the chosen **real** devices in
parallel on Browserstack App Automate

# Which devices are being used?

It can be seen in the `browserstack.yml` file.
[Plug and play Browserstack SDK](https://www.browserstack.com/blog/introducing-browserstack-sdk/) :rocket:

You can choose to change the choice of devices by specifying different capabilities.

For ease of use: use [Browserstack's capability generator](https://www.browserstack.com/app-automate/capabilities)

It can also be triggered from the github actions.
Simply go to the "Actions" tab on this repo and trigger a workflow.


**HAPPY TESTING**
